### Comments on the code:

- I tested this by making a CSV file based of the one in the prompt. That test file is in this repository named fw.csv
- If I had a little more time I would love to edit the accept_packet class function as it could be further imporved by making another function to make the process more modular
- I edited this code in Sublime Text using Python 2.7

### Comments on the code:

- I tested this by making a CSV file based of the one in the prompt. That test file is in this repository named fw.csv
- If I had a little more time I would love to edit the accept_packet class function as it could be further imporved by making another function to make the process more modular
- Also, If i had more time, I would make not make an array to store all of the values in the .csv file. This implementation of an array could take up a lot of space when the data in the .csv file would be say 500 thousand lines. I would run a for loop for every line of the .csv file and check if the values in that line matches with the user input. This implementation of an array would only be of index 4. Hence, much more efficient than the current implementation. 
- I edited this code in Sublime Text using Python 2.7
